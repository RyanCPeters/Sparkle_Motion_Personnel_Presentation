Personnel Activity
===

### Introduction  
For this activity, we will be splitting the room in half. 4 groups on Jeff's left, and 4 groups on Jeff's right. 
  
Don't think of this as teams, as we'll be combining our work in the end. Also, we will be giving identical instructions to both sides of the room going forward.


### Activity Steps

1. First, starting in the back of the room, label the groups from 1 to 4.
2. From that number, you can map to your starting technique using the table at the end of this list.
3. Each group needs to grab a white-board off the wall and at the top put your assigned starting Technique.
  - These boards will be passed between groups on your side of the room. 
  - Each group will have a turn to create an appraisal question/statement on each of the 4 white-boards on their side of the room.
    + We will call out when to switch white-boards, and what your appraisal criteria will be with each switch 
  - Thus, each group will make 1 contribution to each of the 4 techniques we are using in this activity. 
4. Once the white-board you started with is returned to your group
  - pair up with the group that shares your assigned number on the other side of the room 
  - ... and try to build the best 4 statement appraisal for your board's appraisal technique that you can.
    + just circle the statements you want to keep from each board
  - Metrics for choosing which statements you will want to keep should include:
    + Does the statement provide meaningful analysis of the specified criteria?
    + Does the statement satisfy the specified purpose?

### Semi-Ambiguous Prompt Time! yayyyâ€¦

The objective of this activity is to create an appraisal form for evaluating the performance of newly hired employees at the company Tizzy-Whickers. Tizzy-Whickers is an industry leader in the revolutionary new technology of fraudulent self-replicating-memes.

Their technology base is centered around using machine learning to maintain and adapt analytics systems for tracking and categorizing popular memes and identifying the rogue self-replicators. The company is still relatively small, with a single office in the greater Seattle area which hosts 200 employees of various skill sets, 50 of which are software engineers. 

Tizzy-Whickers prides itself on being a progressive company that not only places emphasis on being diverse, but actually depends upon it in order to account for and understand the many facets of culture that can influence new and emerging memes. The company also places a heavy emphasis on employee involvement in their surrounding community, as they've found that employees whom take on challenges and solve problems from outside of their work will often be more capable of recognizing none-obvious solutions in their work.

The guinea pig for your form will be the mad-scientist, Professor Jeff! 

The Professor has discovered a way to create clones of himself. These clones will super rapidly mature to the age of twenty-something, though they are virtually identical to the original at that age, they only contain a small fraction of the actual Professor's accumulated knowledge. That said, they are ready to enter the workforce, where they will carry out all kinds of mad-science'y things. As it just so happens, one of them was recently hired at Tizzy-Whickers, and his 3 month performance appraisal is coming up!
